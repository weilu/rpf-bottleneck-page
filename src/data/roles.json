            "description": "Finance ministries and other central agencies play a fundamental coordinating role when it comes to policy decisions, functioning as a clearing house for various policy proposals across sector institutions, promoting dialogue and consultation around policy trade-offs, and ultimately linking policy objectives with resorce availablility, mobilization and use.  This helps build commitment to policy decisions that are made and improves their feasibiltiy and the likelihood that they will be implemented.",

Since the early 2000s Chile has used a structural budget balance rule to save excess revenue in boom years and permit deficits in recessions. Under this framework (adopted in 2001 and strengthened by the Fiscal Responsibility Law of 2006), the government plans budgets based on long-term copper prices and trend GDP, ensuring fiscal policy leans against the business cycle. For example, President Bachelet’s administration saved windfall copper revenues in sovereign funds during the 2005–2008 boom, despite political pressure to spend, then used those savings for a stimulus when the 2009 recession hit. This institutional design (including independent expert panels for projections) has allowed Chile to implement counter-cyclical policy within its means. ",
